# NQueens_metaheuristic-algorithm

The first part (C++) uses random restart hill climbing and simulated annealing to do the time and the longest, shortest and average time of the total number of single solutions for N queens .


The second part (Pytohn) uses tabu search to do the total and average time in random iterations of N queens.
